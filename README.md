This is my detailed summary of my project about my Netflix media history and my step count data from 2020 untikl January 2024. This GitHub repositary contains a ReadMe file, a report, a power point presentation, and last but not least, a file that includes my personal Netflix and step count Data and the Python code to manipulate these Data.
1️⃣ReadMe File: This file gives information about how this GitHUb repositary will be used. Before you take a look to other files, it may be better to check this information.
2️⃣Data File: In this file, my whole code and data from Netflix and Apple Health CSV is included. In my Netflix Data, there are every movie and TV show episode that I have been watching since the start of  2020 with their exact dates as dd-mm-yyyy. In my Apple Health CSV Data, there is information of my movement based on the number of steps on every instance of the day since the start of 2020. These information come with the date of the movement and number of the steps taken.
In python code I abstract this information and divided to certain parts. This parts are used to reach new results and informations with visualized graphs. In the code every step is commented to make you really understand the goal and reuslt of the code.
3️⃣Report: Report is an informatic text file with it's numerical information and shared technical knowledges. It gives information about data and data's result as well.
4️⃣PowerPoint: But if you want to have an extended and more interesting presentation, PowerPoint is ready to be used. Besides the information about my data, it gives a lot of interesting knowledge and help you to understand the motivation of the goal and desire of my project.
